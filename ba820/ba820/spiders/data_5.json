{"review": ["\nI am currently at this rehab center and apparently between 2010 and now a lot has changed. I was sent here after a botched surgery which then required emergency surgery to correct and put me in a 3 week coma. I lost my ability to walk, write,  my speech was slurred and I lost 45 pounds. This is also a senior care hospital.  Their rehab center is excellent and is helping me  to recover my walking, speech etc. As for the rest, my nurses are friendly,  very attentive and quick with care. A friend who visited who has done volunteer work in a number of senior citizens homes said this is one of the nicest he's seen so clearly things have improved since the previous review. \n", "\nMy father has been there for many months.  It sometimes takes an hour to change him/clean him up.  He continually gets life threatening infections including scavies.  Although the nurses are nice, there just aren't enough to care for the patients properly.  The rooms are ok but my mother has to continually clean and disinfect them each time they move him to a new room.  One of the biggest problems is with billing and their complete lack of care towards billing insurance and filling out the proper paperwork.  We can't even get reimbursed due to the constantly incorrect codes they are using to bill our insurance.  Do not use this facility unless you need extremely short time care and not much attention.\n"], "medical_number": ["056195"], "name": ["\nHancock Park Rehabilitation & Nursing Center \n", "\n"]}
