{"review": ["\nI visited Westside Health Care. It was very nice. They were very accommodating. They took their time with us. They were very cordial, very helpful, and very forthright. I really appreciated them and everything about them. They have different games. They have a calendar full of something that they do everyday.\n\n", "\nI have found a facility for my patient. The patient went to Westside Health Care. I came across them on a resource book. The staff is very limited. From a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give the staff a 3. The rooms are barely clean. They have activities like bingo. I would not recommend this facility to others. They need to improve on their cleanliness.\n\n"], "medical_number": ["555139"], "name": ["\nWestside Health Care\n"]}
