{"review": ["\nI enjoyed the visit with my client at Angels Nursing Health Center. Although this facility was not the cleanest that I have seen, the staff were very friendly and compassionate towards my client and the others that they were caring for.\n\nMy client enjoyed staying there, and said that they treated him well. He stated that the food was good, the nurses responded promptly to any requests that he had made, and that overall - he liked being at this facility.\n\nIt is close to the metro train station, and within minutes of Chinatown and Wilshire - which has plenty to do - such as restaurants and shopping for when family members come in to visit.\n\nI recommend Angels Nursing Health Center for insurance-only patients who are unable to afford private pay facilities.\n\n"], "medical_number": ["055704"], "name": ["\nAngels Nursing Health Center\n"]}
