{"review": ["\nWe decided against Bonnie Brae because it's in a bad part of town. The location for me was depressing, but that has nothing to do with the place itself. It looked old, but it was very clean. The people were very kind to us. They gave me a nice tour, and it looked clean. There were as many as four people in a room, but mostly there are two people in a room separated by a curtain. I didn't see anything negative except that it looked crowded, and it was sort of dark in there.\n\n"], "medical_number": ["055538"], "name": ["\nBonnie Brae Convalescent Hosp\n"]}
