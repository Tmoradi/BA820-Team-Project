       "'\\nAfter reading the other reviews left on this page, I knew I had to write one of my own.  The staff at Burns goes above and beyond.  My mother was very reluctant to be admitted, but she ended up loving it even more than I could have hoped.  The staff is kind and compassionate, and the activities provided kept her mind active and engaged.  The food....oh my goodness...the food was just like home.  It was always well-prepared and delicious.  Every single staff member made it a point to show my mother they cared and genuinely wanted her to be comfortable and content.  They also wanted her to know that they cared about her as a person, not just as someone on the hall they cared for to do their job.  The quality of care at Burns is the type care you would want for your loved one, and it is without a doubt the cleanest nursing home I have ever been inside.  \\n,\\nI have nothing but good things to say about Burns Nursing Home. My Mother received the very best care from each and every employee in all departments.. It was so much a family environment. All the employees seemed so happy all of the time. If ,at any time, my family need to be placed in a Nursing Home. This will be our first choice. Keep up the good work Burns !!'"
