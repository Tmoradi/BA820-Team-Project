{"review": ["\nI thought Jewish Home (Grancell Village) was the best one my husband had ever been in. We were not Jewish, but it was one of the best. The care there was unbelievable. They had entertainment and they had excellent food. Most of them were regular food, but they were very good. The whole thing was great. You could go outside. They had a beautiful garden area, you could sit on one of the tables, and they had several picnic tables there. They actually had a store for the visitors to be able to buy sandwiches or something for themselves.\n\n", "\nWhen we took my wife to the doctor, she couldn\u2019t stand up or walk at all, and they transferred her over to Los Angeles Jewish Home For the Aging for a time to rest up and for occupational and physical therapy: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The physical therapy was primary walking exercise and in the afternoon occupational, she was doing sitting exercises and moving her arms. They kept the place very clean and well-maintained.\n\n"], "medical_number": ["555137"], "name": ["\nLos Angeles Jewish Home\n"]}
